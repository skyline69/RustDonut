# <p align="center"> __Rust Donut üç©__ </p>
This is a Rust implementation of the famous **C Donut**. The code uses the Rayon library for parallel processing and is optimized for performance to make the donut rendering as fast as possible.

## Credits

The original C implementation of the Donut was created by <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">Andy Sloane</a>. This Rust implementation was created by skyline69.

## Notes

This implementation includes a trait UncheckedIndexExt to make the code safer when accessing elements of a string slice by index. This trait is not necessary, but improves the performance of the code.
